It's a 2d schut game

I have a lot of fun doing boss fights and ive been playing some hard games lately so making a short game about fighting a big single boss was something i'd been looking forward to.
Similar games of that vein would be Alien Soldier on the genesis, the Power Fox flash game series and various other games by that developer.

Design-wise, Touhou Project is a HUGE inspiration, it has these beautiful and complex firing patters during their boss fights and mimicking that same kind of organized chaos would be perfect for this kind of boss-only game.
